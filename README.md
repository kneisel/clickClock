# clickClock
Clickable Clock (jQuery plugin)

This JQuery plugin offers a highly customizable graphical clock.
It shows the Time (hour, minutes and optionally second), with a digit and a surrounding circular segment.

Customization can be done on:
- size of a clock-element
- display of digits and circular segment (ring)
- display of second (INtervals are set correspondingly)
- the font, color, size and position of the digits withing clock-element
- width of the rings, color of each ring

The plugin uses dynamically generated, minimalistic SVG and thus concerves resources.

Usage: Download .html and .js files and start .html-file
